Building an intelligent routing system for customer feedback and experience can significantly enhance customer service and operational efficiency. To develop the automatic labeling system for customer feedback/tickets following method is proposed.


    1.**Develop a Taxonomy of Intent**: Create a structured classification system to accurately categorize customer feedback tickets, ensuring they are correctly assigned to the relevant product or service support category.

    2.**Auto-Extract Intent Using Embeddings**: Utilize embedding techniques to represent the intents in the taxonomy as numerical vectors. Store these embeddings, and for each new review, calculate its embedding. Extract the intent by matching the review's embedding with the stored intent embeddings and selecting the highest match.

    3.**Train an ML Model Classification**: Develop and train a machine learning model using labeled data to classify the intents of customer feedback tickets accurately.

    4.**Handle New Products**: For newly introduced products, identify potential intents, calculate their embeddings, and add these embeddings to the existing set. Match the embeddings of new reviews against this updated set to accurately extract and classify intents.
